# **Interpolated Bucket Sort**
An innovative sorting algorithm that leverages interpolation and recursive bucketing to achieve competitive performance across diverse datasets. It efficiently handles edge cases and scales well with large datasets, redefining sorting efficiency.

## **Overview**
Interpolated Bucket Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm designed to overcome the limitations of traditional sorting methods such as Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort.
By dynamically distributing elements into buckets based on interpolated positions within their value range, it excels in sorting diverse datasets, including large value ranges, sparse distributions, and duplicates.

### **Analysis**
- **Interpolated Bucket Sort (IBS)** consistently excels in handling large ranges, sparse distributions, and sorted data.
- Quick Sort now demonstrates significant improvements with balanced performance across most test cases.
- For **large datasets**, IBS still shows scalability but can lag slightly compared to Merge Sort and Heap Sort in high-complexity scenarios.
